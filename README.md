# Book Search Engine

## Description

Provided with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine originally built with a RESTful API - task was to refactor into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. Original was built following a MERN stack template composed of a REACT front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

Existing RESTful API replaced with Apollo Server/GraphQL queries and mutations to modify input. This included modification of middleware to work with GraphQL API and creating an Apollo Provider to facilitate interaction with Apollo Server.

Application deployed via Heroku using a MongoDB Database and MongoDB Atlas.
